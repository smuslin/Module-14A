# Module-14 Module 14 / Algorithm Trading using Machine Learning SVM versus Decision Tree Classifier
#1 SVM produced better returns than the original returns.
#2 Tuning the learning time for SVM to 6 months rather than 3 months produced better returns.
#3 Tuning the moving average windows up from short window 4 to 30 and long window 100 to 200 produced less accuracy and lower returns for the SVM.
#4 Tuning the moving average windows down from long window 100 to 75 and  50 while keeping short window 4 produced less accuracy and a lower return for the SVM.
#5 Tuning the moving average windows up for both the short 4 to 10 and long 100 to 150 produced better accuracy but same returns.
#6 Best adjustement for better results came from keeping same training windows short ma at 4 and long ma at 100 but increasing the training time from 3 to 6 months for the svm.
#7 Adding a different Machine Learning with Decission Tree Classifier produced less accuracy but better returns than both the SVM strategy and the actula retu
