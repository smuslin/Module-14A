# Module-14 Module 14 / Algorithm Trading using Machine Learning SVM versus Decision Tree Classifier
#1 SVM yielded superior returns compared to the original returns.
#2 Extending the learning time for SVM from 3 months to 6 months resulted in improved returns.
#3 Increasing the moving average windows from a short window of 4 to 30 and a long window of 100 to 200 led to decreased accuracy and lower returns for the SVM.
#4 Reducing the moving average windows from a long window of 100 to 75 and 50 while maintaining a short window of 4 resulted in decreased accuracy and lower returns for the SVM.
#5 Enhancing the moving average windows for both the short (from 4 to 10) and long (from 100 to 150) windows improved accuracy but maintained the same returns.
#6 The most effective adjustment for better results involved keeping the same training windows (short MA at 4 and long MA at 100) but increasing the training time from 3 to 6 months for the SVM.
#7 Introducing a different Machine Learning model with Decision Tree Classifier resulted in lower accuracy but better returns compared to both the SVM strategy and the actual returns.
